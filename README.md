# Portfolio & ASCII Art Globe

This repository contains my personal portfolio website, featuring a unique animated ASCII art spinning globe on the landing page, and a modern, responsive portfolio design. The project is currently split into two main parts:

- **portfolio-vite/**: The main source code for the portfolio website, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
- **asciiart.py**: A Python script for converting images to ASCII art, used for generating static ASCII art assets.

## Features

- Animated ASCII art spinning globe on the homepage
- Responsive portfolio site based on a modern Figma template
- Contact form and About Me section
- Clean, monospaced design with custom icons

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build
- [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) for icons
- [Python (Pillow)](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) for ASCII art generation

## Folder Structure

```
/portfolio-vite    # Main portfolio web app (React + Vite)
